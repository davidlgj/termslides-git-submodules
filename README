show.sh - A terminal-based presentation of git submodules
=========================================================

How to start
-------------------------------
The script is based on bash so it should work on unix/linux systems. 
Don't know much about cygwin... infos are appreciated ;-)

* clone this repo to your local machine
* install the demo environment: ./show.sh install
* start the presentation with: ./show.sh "cat ~/your/dir/s?.txt"

Inside the presentation
-------------------------------
You can switch the slides with the arrow-keys or typing a number to
jump to slides. Use ? to get more help...

If a '*' appears at the prompt, there are some commands to 
execute analog to this slide. Use '>' and return to enter the 
prompt-mode. You can see the commands to be executed in the 
brackets. Just hit enter to execute them...

To return back to the presentation use 'q'.

Have fun.
